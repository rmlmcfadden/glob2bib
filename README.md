# `glob2bib`

A bibliography generator for BibTeX and BibLaTeX/Biber.

Bibliography management is a tedious, but a necessary endeavor when writing any technical document. Naturally, one accumulates many references while researching a topic and it is often convenient to organize them in some "centralized" manner (e.g., a large, monolithic `.bib` file or several smaller ones). Instead of copying the whole collection into every project, it is preferable to include only those entries that are actually needed. This not only keeps the document source uncluttered, but also prevents unecessarily long LaTeX compile times due to needlessly parsing over a large number of unused `.bib` entries. Of course, doing this manually is a nuisance and should be avoided at all costs. Thanks to `glob2bib`, one never needs to resort to such primitive sorting practices again!

Taking an `.aux` file and directory as input, `glob2bib`:
1) extracts all the citation keys listed in the `.aux` file
2) recursively find all the `.bib` files found within the specified directory
3) extracts all the entries from the `.bib` files whose keys match those list in the `.aux` file
4) prints the extracted entries to the terminal or optionally writes them to a file

For convenience, `glob2bib` works for `.aux` files generated by both BibTeX or BibLaTeX/Biber workflows. Similarly, it can also optionally convert unicode greek literals found in the extracted entries to (escaped) greek math TeX commands. The latter feature is particularly useful when different documents use different TeX engines (e.g., pdfTeX or LuaTeX).

# Installation

`glob2bib` is just a simple `Python` script with no external dependencies. For convenience, a `Makefile` is included for lazy integration into *nix systems. Installation is as easy as:
```
make install
```
Note that, as per usual, superuser privilages are required for this.

# Usage

Typical use looks like:
```
glob2bib my-document.aux path/to/bib/database -o my-references.bib
```
which will output the extracted entries to a new `.bib` file `my-references.bib`.

A full discription of all input options can be obtained using:
```
glob2bib --help
```
